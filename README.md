# C# Final Project Application in Data Structures and Algorithms
Just Due It is a simple to-do list application that enables users to efficiently create, edit, delete, and organize tasks. It features task categorization, searching, and sorting by type or due date. Tasks are saved locally in a JSON file, ensuring offline accessibility and data persistence. The application is built with a user-friendly interface using Windows Forms in C#.
The motivation for this project is to demonstrate the practical application of data structures in software development while addressing the need for an offline, intuitive task management tool. The primary objective is to help users stay organized by providing a lightweight yet effective solution for managing daily tasks.
